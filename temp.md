❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() {return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ **ReferenceError Risk:** The variables `a` and `b` are undeclared within the function's scope, nor are they passed as arguments. This will result in a `ReferenceError` if `a` or `b` are not defined in an accessible outer scope (e.g., global scope), which is unpredictable and generally bad practice.
*   ❌ **Lack of Parameters:** The function doesn't accept any parameters, making its behavior dependent on external, potentially changing, state (global variables). This severely limits its reusability and makes it difficult to understand its inputs at a glance.
*   ❌ **Poor Readability & Maintainability:** Without explicit inputs, the function's purpose is ambiguous, and debugging issues related to `a` or `b` becomes challenging as their origin is not clear.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 * @param {number} a - The first number.
 * @param {number} b - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
 */
function sum(a, b) {
  // Optional: Add input validation for robustness, e.g., if non-numbers could be passed
  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
    // A more robust application might throw an error or handle it specifically
    // throw new TypeError("Both arguments must be numbers.");
    console.warn("sum() expected numbers, but received non-numeric input. Attempting operation anyway.");
  }
  return a + b;
}

// Example Usage:
// const result = sum(5, 3); // result will be 8
// console.log(result);
```

💡 Improvements:
*   ✔ **Clear Parameters:** `a` and `b` are now explicitly defined as parameters, making the function's inputs clear and predictable.
*   ✔ **Enhanced Reusability:** The function can now be easily reused with any two numbers, decoupling it from the global scope and promoting modular design.
*   ✔ **Improved Readability & Maintainability:** The function signature immediately conveys what inputs are expected, and the JSDoc comments provide clear documentation for future developers.
*   ✔ **Error Prevention:** Eliminates the `ReferenceError` by ensuring `a` and `b` are always defined within the function's local scope when it's called with arguments.
*   ✔ **Function Purity:** By relying solely on its inputs and producing an output without side effects, this version adheres to principles of pure functions, making it easier to test and reason about.
*   ✔ **Robustness (Optional):** Added an optional check for `typeof` arguments to ensure they are numbers, preventing unexpected behavior if the function is called with non-numeric values. This enhances the reliability of the function.
